<p>Hi folks! I am about to merge a pull request that replaces <code>--arch-word-bits</code> with a new directive <code>global size_of usize == 8;</code> (or <code>global size_of usize == 4;</code>) which sets the size of <code>usize</code> (and <code>isize</code>, as it's related) <em>and</em> adds a static assertion that, when compiled, <code>usize</code> has the expected size. If you're using <code>--arch-word-bits 64</code> you'll now need  <code>global size_of usize == 8;</code> inside the <code>verus!</code> macro, ideally at the root of your project. This change does not yet support <code>core::mem::size_of::&lt;usize&gt;()</code>, but an upcoming one will.</p>
