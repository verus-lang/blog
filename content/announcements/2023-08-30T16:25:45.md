<p>The pull request <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/pull/741">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/pull/741</a> has just been merged. This changes the mechanism for <code>reveal</code> so that type arguments are not required anymore (see the PR for details). This is a breaking change, because, in an impl for type <code>A</code>, <code>Self::</code> is not supported anymore in the argument to reveal/reveal_with_fuel/hide; you can replace it with <code>A::</code> in an <code>impl A</code> block, and with <code>&lt;A as Tr&gt;::</code> in an <code>impl Tr for A</code> block.</p>
