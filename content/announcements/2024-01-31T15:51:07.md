<p>Hello, you can now pass named functions directly as values (exec functions only). For example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>fn a&lt;F: Fn(u8) -&gt; bool&gt;(f: F) { ... }

fn b(value: u8) -&gt; bool { ... }

fn main() {
  // This now works:
  a(b);

  // Previously you would have had to create a closure:
  a(|x: u8| b(x));
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>As with closures, you can use <code>b.requires(args)</code> and <code>b.ensures(args, output)</code> to access the precondition and postcondition. You can also use <code>call_requires(b, args)</code> or <code>call_ensures(b, args, output)</code>.</p>
