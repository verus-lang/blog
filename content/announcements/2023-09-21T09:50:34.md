<p>Hi folks, I am about to merge two commits that require action from users:</p>
<ul>
<li>next time you pull, please rebuild <code>vargo</code> by following Step 3 of <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/blob/main/INSTALL.md">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/blob/main/INSTALL.md</a>, and</li>
<li><code>assert forall #![trigger Q(x)] |x| P(x)</code> is now consistent with regular <code>forall</code>, i.e. you will need to change those to <code>assert forall |x| #![trigger Q(x)]  P(x)</code> (the trigger annotation moves after the <code>|x|</code>). The same applies for <code>#![auto]</code>.</li>
</ul>
