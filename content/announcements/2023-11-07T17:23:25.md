<p>I'm about to merge <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/pull/771">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/pull/771</a> .  With this, any items (e.g. functions, datatypes, etc.) declared outside the <code>verus!</code> macro will be considered external to the verifier by default.  This means that by default, Verus will not attempt to verify or process such items.  If you want such an item to be verified or visible to the verifier, you can either put it inside <code>verus!</code> or mark it <code>#[verifier::verify]</code>.  The reason for this new behavior is that some projects contain a lot of unverified code and a little verified code, and we don't want to have to mark every item in the unverified code as <code>#[verifier::external]</code>.  (For backwards compatibility, if you don't want this new default behavior, there is for now a flag <code>--no-external-by-default</code> that will opt out of this new behavior and restore the old behavior.)</p>
