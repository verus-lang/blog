<p>Hi folks, we recently renamed <code>FnSpec</code> to <code>spec_fn</code>. FnSpec was originally named following the convention of FnOnce, etc., but since it's a type rather than a trait, we decided to make it look more like <code>fn</code> instead. Hence, <code>spec_fn</code>.</p>
<p>FnSpec should keep working for the time being, except for the deprecation warnings, but will be removed at some point.</p>
