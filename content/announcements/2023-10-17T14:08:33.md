<p>Hi folks! FYI, I pushed a commit that re-organizes the command line options to reduce the number of top-level options, moving some of the less commonly used features to sub-flags, to make <code>--help</code> easier to scan. In particular, there's a new set of options (<code>-V</code>, modeled against rustc's <code>-Z</code>) for extended/experimental flags.</p>
