<p>Hi folks! A heads up that I am planning to merge <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/pull/978">PR 978</a> on Monday morning UTC. This will upgrade z3 to the latest release (4.12.5); this may cause existing proofs to break (due to changes in z3â€™s heuristics). Based on preliminary testing we expect limited breakage but be aware that when you pick up the merge commit you may need to tweak the proofs for certain functions. I will post another announcement when I merge the change.</p>
