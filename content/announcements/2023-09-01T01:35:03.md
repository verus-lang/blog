<p>A recent commit accidentally introduced an issue that resulted in imprecise spans being reported for error messages (the parts of the source underlined with <code>^^^^^^</code> or <code>------</code> in an error message) and caused a bad interaction between rust-analyzer (in vscode) and <code>vargo</code> that resulted in the build cache being invalidated more often than necessary, which caused <code>vargo</code> to often rebuild Verus and its dependencies from scratch. This has been fixed in a recent commit <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/commit/3a7b70f2123b144059073e97d27b05aef04f3bf4">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/commit/3a7b70f2123b144059073e97d27b05aef04f3bf4</a>. If you have already built Verus and you pull the new changes, you will need to rebuild vargo by following Step 3 of <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/blob/main/INSTALL.md">https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/blob/main/INSTALL.md</a> .</p>
