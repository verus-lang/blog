<p>Hi all! I have just merged <a href="https://github.com/verus-lang/verus/pull/978">PR 978</a>. Next time you pull <code>main</code> you will need to obtain z3 4.12.5 (using <code>./tools/get-z3.(sh|ps1)</code>. Vargo will check that the current version of z3 is the correct one, and let you know otherwise (you can override this check with <code>--no-solver-version-check</code> but note that current Verus will only successfully build with 4.12.5 (as we are using a new z3 option that was released in this version). As a reminder: updating z3 may cause existing proofs to break (due to changes in z3â€™s heuristics). Based on preliminary testing we expect limited breakage but be aware that when you pick up the merge commit you may need to tweak the proofs for certain functions. Let us know if you experience extensive breakage or if you encounter other issues.</p>
